abstract = {The aim of the present study was to find methods for enhancing rates of hydrocarbon biodegradation in gasoline contaminated soil by ex situ bioremediation. Red soil (RS) was treated with gasoline-spilled soil (GS) from a gasoline station and different combinations of amendments were prepared using (i) mixed bacterial consortium (MC), (ii) poultry litter (PL), (iii) coir pith (CP) and (iv) rhamnolipid biosurfactant (BS) produced by Pseudomonas sp. DS10-129. The study was conducted for a period of 90 days during which bacterial growth, hydrocarbon degradation and growth parameters of Phaseolus aureus RoxB including seed germination, chlorophyll content, shoot and root length were measured. Approximately 67% and 78% of the hydrocarbons were effectively degraded within 60 days in soil samples amended with RS+GS+MC+PL+CP+BS at 0.1% and 1%. Maximum percentage of seed germination, shoot length, root length and chlorophyll content in P. aureus were recorded after 60 days in the above amendments. Further incubation to 90 days did not exhibit significant improvements. Statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT) revealed that the level of amendments, incubation time and combination of amendments significantly influenced bacterial growth, hydrocarbon degradation, seed germination and chlorophyll content at a 1% probability level. All tested additives MC, PL, CP and rhamnolipid BS had significant positive effects on the bioremediation of GS.}

abstract = {Laboratory and field pilot studies were carried out on the bioremediation of soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons in the Borhola oil fields, Assam, India. The effects of aeration, nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) and inoculation of extraneous microbial consortia on the bioremediation process were investigated. The beneficial effects of these parameters on the bioremediation rate were realised equally in laboratory and field pilot tests. The field tests revealed that up to 75% of the hydrocarbon contaminants were degraded within 1 year, indicating the feasibility of developing a bioremediation protocol. A complementary computer simulation study was carried out to enhance the understanding of the basic processes and the rate determining factors for bioremediation under the practically relevant conditions of Borhola oil fields. The simulations indicated that due to the high initial contaminant concentrations, the bioremediation process was restricted mostly to the macropores of the system within the period of 1 year and had not penetrated into the soil aggregates sufficiently. Certain shortcomings of the model have been identified and possible refinements suggested.}

abstract  ="The novel heterogeneous bimetallic nanoparticles of Cu–Co were synthesized based on magnetic nanoparticles{,} and the magnetic nanocatalyst was characterized by XRD{,} FE-SEM{,} EDX mapping{,} BET{,} TEM{,} HRTEM{,} FTIR{,} TGA{,} and VSM. This catalyst was successfully applied as a recyclable magnetically catalyst in Heck{,} Suzuki{,} and C–N cross-coupling reactions with various aryl halides (iodides{,} bromides{,} and chlorides as challengeable substrates){,} with olefins{,} phenylboronic acid{,} and amines{,} respectively. We considered the rise of synergetic effects from the different Lewis acid and Brønsted acid sites present in the catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized with cheap{,} available materials and a simple synthesis method. The catalyst can be separated easily using an external magnet. It was recycled for more than ten runs without a sensible loss of its catalytic activity{,} and no significant leaching of the Cu and Co quantity was observed. The significant benefits of the method are high-level generality{,} simple operation{,} and there are no heavy metals and toxic solvents. This is a quick{,} easy{,} efficacious and environmentally friendly protocol{,} and no by-products are formed in the reaction. These features make it an appropriate practical alternative protocol. In comparison with recent works{,} the other advantage of this catalyst is the synthesis of a wide variety of C–C and C–N bond derivatives (more than 40 derivatives). The other significant advantage is the low temperature of the reaction and the use of the least possible amount of the catalyst (0.003 g). The efficiency was good to excellent and the catalyst selectivity has been high. We aspire that our study inspires more interest to design novel catalysts based on using low-cost metal ions (such as cobalt and copper) in the cross-coupling reactions."}
