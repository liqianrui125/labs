    abstract = "{Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can be used to determine the concentration and speciation of dissolved water in silicate glasses if the molar absorptivity coefficients (ε) are known. Samples that are thin and/or water-poor typically require the use of the mid-IR 3500 cm–1 total water (H2Ot) and 1630 cm–1 molecular water (H2Om) absorbance bands, from which hydroxyl water (OH) must be determined by difference; however, accurate determination of H2Ot and OH is complicated because ε3500 varies with water speciation, which is not usually known a priori. We derive an equation that uses end-member ε3500 values to find accurate H2Ot and OH concentrations from the 3500 cm–1 absorbance for samples where only the H2Om concentration need be known (e.g., from the 1630 cm–1 band). We validate this new species-dependent ε3500 method against published data sets and new analyses of glass standards. We use published data to calculate new end-member ε3500 values of ε3500OH = 79 ± 11 and ε3500H2Om = 49 ± 6 L/mol·cm for Fe-bearing andesite and ε3500OH = 76 ± 12 and ε3500H2Om = 62 ± 7 L/mol·cm for Fe-free andesite. These supplement existing end-member values for rhyolite and albite compositions. We demonstrate that accounting for the species-dependence of ε3500 is especially important for hydrated samples, which contain excess H2Om, and that accurate measurement of OH concentration, in conjunction with published speciation models, enables reconstruction of original pre-hydration water contents. Although previous studies of hydrous silicate glasses have suggested that values of ε decrease with decreasing tetrahedral cation fraction of the glass, this trend is not seen in the four sets of end-member ε3500 values presented here. We expect that future FTIR studies that derive end-member ε3500 values for additional compositions will therefore not only enable the species-dependent ε3500 method to be applied more widely, but will also offer additional insights into the relationship between values of ε and glass composition.}",

abstract = {Gases released from pyrolysis and partial combustion of various polymers (low-density polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(parabromostyrene), pure and flame-retarded polypolyamide 6, cellulose, and chloroprene) were studied using a new coupling between Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry (PCFC). Combustion in PCFC was monitored by modifying the combustion temperature between 600 and 900°C. Decreasing the combustion temperature in PCFC leads to partial combustion and the evolution of CO, but also of methane, acetylene, or ethylene when temperature is very low. The evolution of these gases depends also on the polymer and on the presence of a flame inhibitor, demonstrating that flame inhibition can be studied using this method. A correlation between FTIR–PCFC and FTIR–cone calorimetry coupling was attempted via the CO/CO2 ratio. The first results show that an “isoconversion temperature” in the cone calorimeter test may be estimated. Polar gases such as chlorinated or brominated gases are not fully observed using this method due to possible adsorption in the transfer line before they reach the FTIR gas cell.}

abstract = {The spectrum of CO has been observed using a heated absorption tube. J values up to 48 for the 2-0 band and up to ∼35 for the 3-1 and 4-2 bands were measured. Using previous measurements of the 2-0 band and the results of microwave determinations a set of rotation-vibration constants was deduced. The vibrational constants in vacuum wave numbers are: We = 2169.8232,WeXe = -13.2932,WeYe= 0.01144. The rotational constants are: B0 = 1.922 521, D0 = −6.1193 × 10−6, H0 = 5.8 × 10−12, αe = −0.017507, βe = 1.0 × 10−9, γe = 1.0 × 10−6. Calculated values for lines in the 5-3, 6-4, and 7-5 bands agree within experimental error with the results of measurement of lines in the solar spectrum.}
